This module is about creating a blockchain that can be mined. 

The problem in this blockchain is that the generated SHA256 hash should have four leading zeros.

I have used the previous hash to calculate the nuance of the blocks that should be mined.

Verfication of the blockchain is done by calculating the hash of the previous block and comparing to the previous_hash value present in
the current block and also verifying if the hash of present proof has four leading zeroes.

It has basic api's to mine a block, get all blocks of the chain and to check if the blockchian is valid.
